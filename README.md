# Intel8085-Simulator

## Overview
The **Intel8085-Simulator** is a under work (‚ö†Ô∏è) project, aimed at creating a simulator for the **Intel 8085 microprocessor**. It allows users to run binary files containing Intel 8085 opcodes and observe their execution.

## How It Works
1. **Input Binary File**: Users or developers provide a binary file containing Intel 8085 opcodes. This file represents the program they want to simulate.
2. **Simulation Process**:
    - The simulator reads the binary file and interprets the opcodes.
    - It emulates the execution of instructions step by step.
    - Registers, memory, and other components of the 8085 microprocessor are updated accordingly.
3. **Output and Debugging**:
    - Users can observe the state of registers, memory, and other relevant components during execution.
    - Debugging features (such as breakpoints, step-by-step execution, and memory inspection) help identify issues.
    - **Note**: Some opcodes may not be fully implemented yet.

## Features:
- **Instruction Execution**: Simulates the execution of Intel 8085 instructions.
- **Register State**: Displays the current state of registers (accumulator, flags, etc.).

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/akshatd120/Intel8085-Simulator.git
    ```
2. **Compile and Run**:
  Open the Intel-8085-Sim.sln in Visual Studio 22 and build!
